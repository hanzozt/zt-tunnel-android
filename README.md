# Ziti Mobile Edge for Android

This is the Ziti Mobile Edge application released in Google Play store and commonly referred to as "ZME" or "the
Hanzo ZT tunneler for Android."

As a Kotlin application, it leverages [the Hanzo ZT Tunnel SDK](https://github.com/hanzozt/ziti-tunnel-sdk-c?tab=readme-ov-file#readme). In Android, this app is a VPN connector
that provides a nameserver for resolving the addresses of any authorized Hanzo ZT Services.
